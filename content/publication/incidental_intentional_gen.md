abstract = "Memory generalization, the ability to link information across experiences to derive new knowledge, is a fundamental function of memory. Generalization is typically studied using tasks that probe the ability to extract commonalities across items, such as learning new concepts from a set of category examples. Less is known about the extent to which individuals spontaneously extract commonalities across items necessary for generalization when task goals emphasize item-specific information. In the present study, we used blends of faces to create face families and control for within- and between-category similarity. Memory generalization was tested in two experiments with contrasting goals at encoding. In the incidental category-learning experiment, participants underwent paired-associates training of face-name pairs. Faces had a unique first name, but category information was present as shared surnames. In the intentional category-learning experiment, participants underwent traditional feedback-based training of face families. Category bias in perceived similarity served as an implicit measure of category-learning while generalization of surnames to new faces served as an explicit measure. We found evidence of memory generalization irrespective of goals at encoding and prior to any explicit demands to make category judgments. Further, after incidental learning, where item-specific information was tested in addition to generalization, we found no evidence that spontaneous learning of commonalities across faces came at the expense of memory for face-specific information. Together, these results indicate that generalizable knowledge may form spontaneously alongside memory for specific details, enabling us to make distinct types of judgments from the same experiences. NOTE: This paper has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal."
