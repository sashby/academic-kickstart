abstract = "Memory benefits from both repeated study of material and self-testing. The current study sought to determine the best balance between repetition and testing that would maximize long-term memory retention. Participants briefly encountered academically-relevant factual statements three times, either studying them or being tested on them. Statements were assigned into four conditions: 1) studied three times, 2) studied twice and then tested, 3) studied once, then tested, and then restudied after test, and 4) studied once and then tested twice. Retention was assessed through a final cued-recall test administered to half of the participants on the same day and the other half of participants after retention intervals of two days (Experiment 1) or seven days (Experiment 2). Results showed that conditions which contained both repetition and self-testing proved to be the most beneficial for both short and long retention. Restudy after test provided a benefit when tested on the same day but the order of restudy and test did not matter for retention over a delay. Consistent with prior work, items only studied were less likely to be retrieved after a delay compared to items that included some testing opportunities. Replacing all repetitions with test opportunities yielded the least forgetting across a delay but did not maximize performance because less was learned during the single study opportunity. Our results suggest that while self-testing improves memory performance over time better than repetition alone, balancing repetition and testing allows for more information to be learned and retained in long-term memory."
