## About me
Stefania works in the [Brain and Memory Lab] (https://cognem.uoregon.edu/) at the [University of Oregon] (https://psychology.uoregon.edu/) studying learning and memory using neuroimaging. 

## My research
I am interested in understanding the relationship between memory specificity and generalization and exploring to what extent these representations coexist, the neural mechanisms that support their simultaneous construction, and the degree to which our intentions or goals at learning shapes the memory representations we construct. To study these representations I use category learning tasks and utilize functional neuroimaging and multivariate analyses techniques.
