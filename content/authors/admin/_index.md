## About me
I am a doctoral graduate student studying cognitive neuroscience in the [Brain and Memory Lab] (https://cognem.uoregon.edu/) at the [University of Oregon] (https://psychology.uoregon.edu/).

## My research
Flexible memory requires the ability to both recall specific details of our individual experiences---*specificity*---as well as link information across events to derive new knowledge---*generalization*. I am interested in understanding the relationship between memory specificity and generalization and exploring to what extent these representations coexist, the neural mechanisms that support their simultaneous construction, and the degree to which our intentions or goals at learning shapes the memory representations we construct. To study these representations I use category learning tasks and utilize functional neuroimaging and multivariate analyses techniques.
